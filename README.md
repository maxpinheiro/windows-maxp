# windows ma<b>XP</b>
A version of my personal website that attempts to simulate the Windows XP OS! This was the operating system I used growing up and is the reason I developed a passion for both computers and building user interfaces. This recreation is both an experiment to practice my app development/organization and CSS/SVG styling skills, and a playful homage to my beginnings. Hope you enjoy! :)
